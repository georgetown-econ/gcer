Harding,  a Visiting Fellow from Stanford University,  and co-author Michael Lovenheim of Cornell examine the potential effect of a sugar tax on obesity outcomes in the U.S.  Using  data on 123 million food purchases made in the U.S. between 2002 and 2007, they find that a  20%  tax on sugar would result in an 18% reduction in overall caloric intake Americans.
