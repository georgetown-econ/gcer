Georgetown Department of Economics and Center for Economic Research welcome its newest member, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/maryannbronson/">Mary Ann Bronson</a> who joins the department and GCER in the Fall of 2014@@@. Bronson arrives from the University of California, Los Angeles, where she received her PhD.

Her most recent work explores the dynamics of gender differences in college attendance and choice of major. She constructs a dynamic structural model of marriage, educational choices, and lifetime labor supply to analyze the contribution of changes in wages and the marriage market to the observed educational investment patterns over time.
