<p>  New research by two recent GU Economics Phd students, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/boutonllj/"> Jake Mortenson and Andrew Whitten,  </a>  is  featured in the Wall Street Journal's on-line edition. The article, entitled  <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2016/02/11/how-some-americans-hit-the-maximum-tax-refund-sweet-spot/">  "How Some Americans Hit the Maximum Tax-Refund Sweet Spot" </a> discusses research by Mortenson and Whitten on   <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2719859"> "Tax Bunching."  </a>   @@@   Mortenson and Whitten use  tax return data to  document how reported incomes on tax returns  tend to be bunched at the break points in the federal tax code.    Their results quantify the way in which discrete jumps in marginal tax rates  alter the behavior  of households.   </p>
