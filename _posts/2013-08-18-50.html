            As part of GCER' s mission to contribute to the quality of economic research and training in the Washington DC area we are delighted to announce a new initiative in econometric training.In collaboration with the    <a href="http://scs.georgetown.edu/">  Center for Continuing and Professional Education,</a>  GCER will offer an Econometrics intensive seminar program, with an option of earning a non-credit professional Certificate in Econometrics. Program participants may elect to take individual intensive seminars, or to take three seminars in order to earn the Certificate in Econometrics. Taught by internationally renowned economists, Georgetown's econometrics seminars are designed to be of practical and immediate use to individuals across the private and public sectors who seek tools to solve complex problems and inform both policy and practice. Each seminar includes applied experience in estimation, interpretation and evaluation of economic relationships.
