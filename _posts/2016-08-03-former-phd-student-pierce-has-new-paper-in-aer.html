<p> A recent GU graduate of the Department of Economics, <a  href="http://www.justinrpierce.com/"> Justin Pierce </a>, has a paper in the most recent American Economic Review. The paper   <a href="http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.20131578"> "The Surprisingly Swift Decline of
US Manufacturing Employment" </a> links a  `sharp drop in US manufacturing employment
after 2000 to a change in US trade policy that eliminated potential
tariff increases on Chinese imports.'  The paper, jointly authored with Peter K. Schott of the Yale School of Management,  appears in the most recent issue of the AER.
