GCER is set up to support the Department in its efforts to fulfill its core research and instructional mission for  the University.  Its primary goal is to foster an environment of open and  rigorous scientific inquiry into current economic policy  issues and problems. We think you'll find our programs and research  interesting and innovative. More about GCER's mission can be found on <a href="B_About.html"> About GCER,</a>  or scan our activities from the menus or from   <a href="#More About GCER"> Quick Links.</a></p>
