## A New Post

<p>  New research by GCER Fellow <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/boutonllj/"> Laurent Bouton </a>  on voting abstention was recently published in the March 2015 issue of VOX. The article features new research by Bouton and his co-authors Aniol Llorente-Saguer and Frédéric Malherbe on the role of "constructive abstention rules," i.e., rules that treat abstention as "no" votes if they sufficient in number. </p>

<p> As distinct from the silent consent of traditional abstention rules, Bouton, et. al. show that construction abstention can effectively combine the information aggregation aspects of majority rule while still allowing for veto power. <a href="http://www.voxeu.org/article/constructive-abstention-reforming-european-council-voting"> The full VOX article can be found here.</a>  </p>
