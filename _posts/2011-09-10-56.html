Rust will be moving over to Georgetown from the University of Maryland where he has resided  as Professor of Economics  since 2001.  </p>
<p> Rust's research is internationally renowned,   and spans both the technical frontier and the practical side of economics. He is best known for his research on the  development of computationally tractable methods for solving and estimating models  of dynamic decision making under uncertainty.In a series of widely acclaimed publications Rust demonstrated that these discrete dynamic programming models provide accurate predictions of actual human decision making in a variety of contexts. Along the way, he pioneered new algorithms for solving these problems,  attracting  the attention of leading computer scientists and mathematicians working in the field of <em> computational complexity </em>  as well as the economists working in this field.  </p>
<p> Rust has received numerous awards for his research. He was awarded an Alfred Sloan Fellowship in 1988 and a fellowship at the Hoover Institution in Stanford in 1991.  He  was elected as a Fellow of the Econometric Society in 1993 and became a fellow of the TIAA-CREF Institute (the largest retirement fund for college professors) in 2003. In 1997, Rust received the  Ragnar Frisch Medal from The Econometric Society for his first empirical application of the method in the paper, "Optimal Replacement of GMC Bus Engines: An Empirical Model of Harold Zurcher."   </p>
<p> Rust has been on the editorial board of numerous journals including serving as an Associate Editor  at <em>  Econometrica </em>  and co-editor of the <em>  Journal of Applied Econometrics.  </em> He  has  been a consultant to the U.S. Social Security Administration and a member of the Long Term Modeling Advisory Panel at the Congressional Budget Office. He  has served as a member of  the Economics Panel of the National Science Foundation and the Committee on National Statistics of the National Academy of Science, as a member of the Panel on Retirement Income Modeling, and served as  an advisor to the Steering Committee  that advised on the design of the Health and  Retirement Survey (HRS).  </p>
<p> Most recently Rust  has served as a member of the Technical  Advisory Panel to the Social Security Advisory Board, and  a consultant to the Social Security Administration on long term policy modeling via a research contract between SSA and the Urban Institute. </p>
<p> Rust  received his PhD from MIT in 1983,  specializing in applied econometrics. He held previous faculty positions,   first  at the  University of Wisconsin from 1983 to 1995, and then at Yale  from 1996 to 2001. In all his faculty appointments, he has been Professor of Economics since 1990. </p>
