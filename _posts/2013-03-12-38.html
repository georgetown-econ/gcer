            GCER is pleased to announce GCER is pleased to announce that <a href="http://personal.lse.ac.uk/RAZIN/" target="_blank"><b>Ronny Razin</b></a>, Professor of Economics at the London School of Economics will present the 2013 Razin Policy Lecture at Georgetown University. This year's Razin Lecture will take place on <b>Wednesday, April 3, 2013 from 4:00 - 6pm</b> at <b>McShain Large Lounge (Kennedy Hall)</b>. His talk is entitled <b>"The Debate about Online Debates: What Can We Learn From Economic Theory"</b><p></p>
            <p>Ronny Razin is an internationally recognized political economist whose work spans a wide range of issues and problems.  Some of his best known work concerns the critical question of whether democracies aggregate information properly. In most democratic countries, voters are motivated to use the information they have to determine the winning candidate. In one of his more widely acclaimed studies, Professor Razin suggests a second motivation, one no less important:  voters are motivated to use their votes to affect the policy choice of the winning candidate by influencing candidates' beliefs. Professor Razin's research shows how and why these two motivations may conflict to produce unsatisfactory electoral results and policy outcomes. </p>
            <p>Professor Razin has also published several prominent papers on interest group and party formation, and on political communication.  His current work studies the unusual political economics of religion, its role in voting participation, social cooperation, and policy making. This year's Razin Prize Recipient is Mauricio Tejada for his excellent paper on:  "Dual Labor Markets and Labor Protection in an Estimated Search and Matching Model", under the guidance of Luca Flabbi. </p>
            <p>Professor Razin is brother of the late Ofair Razin in whose honor the Lecture is named. The Razin Lecture is to be accompanied by the awarding of the Razin Prize for best research paper by an advanced graduate student. <a href="http://econ.georgetown.edu/programs/graduate/37866.html" target="_blank">Click here</a> for more on the Razin Prize and Policy Lecture, its background, and history.</p>
