Carneiro arrives   from University College London where   he currently holds the rank of    Reader, and  will hold   the rank of  Associate Professor at Georgetown. </p>
            <p>Carneiro comes to GCER with an outstanding record of scholarship and  expertise in the areas of labor economics and applied microeconometrics. His research focuses  on human capital development, that is, the ways in which individuals acquire the skills that determine their earnings potential. These include early childhood development, education, and on-the-job training.   </p>
            <p>Carneiro has much-cited   publications in <em> Econometrica </em> and <em> The American Economic Review </em> among other highly respected outlets. His work figured prominently in a number of areas. One paper, in particular, that has received much attention was co-written with  James Heckman  and  concerns heterogeneous treatment effects. A policy designed to increase college attendance, for example,  can have a strong effect on some parts of the target population but weak (or even negative) effects on other  parts of that population. For many purposes, it is important to be able to estimate the  distribution of treatment effects. Carneiro and Heckman    use  a ``latent factors"  approach  to estimate  the heterogeneous treatment effects, and this approach is now considered  to be  a major methodological innovation in the field.  </p>
            <p>Carneiro  received his PhD at the University of Chicago in 2003. After completing his PhD, he joined the faculty of  University College London.  </p>
