            On January 24, 2012,  the Economics Department and Graduate School at Georgetown University reached a collaborative agreement with <a href="http://www.iza.org/en/webcontent/index_html">              IZA,         </a>   &nbsp;      the internationally renowned research institute focusing on labor market issues. <p></p>
            <p>     The agreement was finalized on the GU campus  and signed by Department and Villani Chair   <a href="http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/fgv/">   Frank Vella, </a>   &nbsp;    IZA Director    <a href="http://www.iza.org/en/webcontent/personnel/photos/zimmermann_html">              Klaus F. Zimmermann,             </a>    &nbsp;    and Graduate Dean <a href="http://explore.georgetown.edu/people/marag/">     Gerald Mara     </a>     &nbsp;        (all pictured at left).   </p>
            <p>       The memorandum  extends the existing collaborative efforts   between the Econ Department and IZA  and initiates a number of   new  programs that  include formal exchanges  of faculty and graduate students and jointly sponsored workshops and conferences. These  initiatives  will largely work through GCER in coordination with IZA.  </p>
