            <p><img src="bai.jpg" align="left" hspace="16" width="165" height="225" border="1">  In their paper, <strong>"Government Purchases Over the Business Cycle: the Role of Economic   and Political Inequality   (GCER Working Paper, 2010),"  </strong>  Ruediger  Bachmann  and   Jinhui H. Bai explore  the implications of economic and political inequality  for the business cycle   comovement of government purchases in the U.S.  They conduct theirquantitative experiments in a standard model of economic growth in which public expenditures  financed by income taxes are determined by the political process. A key feature of their study is a wealth bias in the political process  that disproportionately weights the clout of  upper income groups.  Increases in income inequality therefore lead to increased political inequality.   The analysis shows a negative correlation between wealth bias and the degree of business cycle comovement of government purchases.The estimated wealth bias that matches the observed mild procyclicality of government purchases in the data, is also consistent with cross-sectional survey data on political participation.           </p>
            <p> This effect is illustrated in the graph below where increases in the wealth bias of the policy-making process can be seen to dampen the correlation between income and purchases. </p>
