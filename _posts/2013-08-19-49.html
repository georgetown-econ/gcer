            The inaugural conference on at the Becker-Friedman Institute on <em> Measuring and Interpreting Inequality </em> featured a plenary address by  <a href="http://lonessmith.com/">   Lones Smith </a> (U. Wisconsin), on his joint work with GCER Fellow       <a href="http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/aza/index.html">     Axel Anderson   </a> entitled  "Matching with Evolving Human Capital". The paper revisits Nobelist Gary Becker's classic 1973 paper "A Theory of Marriage", adding in an important unexplored feature  -- namely, that individuals are changed by their peers. When post docs take low wage temporary positions or parents pay for expensive private schooling to keep their children away from bad influences, they make a clear sacrifice of current for future welfare. Anderson and Smith's paper develops the general theory of such matching, and shows how one model simultaneously explains a myriad of time series and cross-sectional wage and matching patterns in the economy. <p></p><p></p>
