            <p align="left"> The second in the series of Distinguished Lectures in 2013-14 will be delivered by Preston McAfee, a leading research economist at Google. McAfee's talk is entitled "Digital Advertising: Benefits and Costs."  This talk summarizes recent experimental results on the effectiveness of internet display advertising (graphic images on web pages).  Three issues are considered: does the length of display time matter?  Is it more effective to switch ads during a page view?  What is the user cost of obnoxious or annoying ads? </p>
            <p><b> The  lecture will be held on October 17th at 4:15-5:45pm in McShain Large Lounge in Kennedy Hall at Georgetown University. </b> </p>
