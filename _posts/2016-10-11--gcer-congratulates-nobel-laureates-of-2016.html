<p> GCER Congratulates the Economic Science Nobel Laureates of 2016 [Oliver Hart](http://scholar.harvard.edu/hart/home) (Harvard) and [Bengt Holmstr√∂m](http://economics.mit.edu/faculty/bengt)(MIT). The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the Prize for their work in Contract Theory. Their work has profoundly shaped economists' understanding of the role of incentives and property rights. Besides providing essential building blocks for a modern theory of the firm, this year Laureates' writings have found applications that span from Corporate Finance, to Labor Economics, to the Economics of Prisons. GCER is also proud to notice that the Nobel Committee in its [Scientific Background Paper](https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2016/advanced-economicsciences2016.pdf) cited a contribution co-authored by GCER Fellow Luca Anderlini ([Anderlini and Felli, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 1994)](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2118357?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents).</p>
