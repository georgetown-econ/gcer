 <p>  <a href="http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/Austan.goolsbee/"> Professor Austan Goolsbee </a> recently  delivered the 2016 <a href="http://econ.georgetown.edu/phd/razin-prize">  Razin Lecture. </a> Professor Goolsbee's talk, "Are We Doomed?", did what dismal scientists often do, answering the question separately for the short and long runs.  @@@  The short run outlook for the US economy is not rosy and unlikely to be rescued by the usual saviors.  The Fed cannot set interest rates lower. Exports depend on healthy economies in other countries. Home construction is unlikely to return to pre-bubble levels. And consumers are unlikely to return to the pre-2008 spending levels that were financed by that bubble. Goolsbee's long-run outlook, however, is less dismal. US productivity and per-capita GDP growth have been steady for decades or centuries, and it's hard to imagine that whatever the 21st century obstacles to growth might be, that they are more imposing than the flu pandemics, depressions, world wars, and oil crises that characterized the 20th century.   </p>
