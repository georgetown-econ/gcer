Having been awarded a two year $3.5 million, two-year grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, GCER Fellows Billy Jack and James Habyarimana will initiate a project to explore innovations to the M-PESA, a mobile money platform launched in 2007 in Kenya to faciliate access to basic financial services via cell phones.  The project  will bring together mobile operators, financial institutions, IT developers and academics to develop and assess the social and economic impact of mobile money innovations. </p>
