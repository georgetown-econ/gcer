George Akerlof, University Professor and recipient of the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences in 2001 will deliver the 2015 Razin Policy Lecture on April 27 at Georgetown University@@@.  The Lecture will take place on Monday, April 27, 2015 from 3:30 to 5:00 in the McShain Large Lounge on the GU campus. A reception will follow. Professor Akerlof is a renowned economist whose innovative work on markets with asymmetric information helped explain why such markets often break down. This work, culminating in his famous paper, “The Market for ‘Lemons'” earned Professor Akerlof the 2001 Nobel Prize in Economics, a prize he shared with Michael Spence. </p>

<p> The Razin Lecture is accompanied by the awarding of the Razin Prize for best research paper by an advanced graduate student. This year's recipient, <a href= "/2014-10-14-razin-prize"> Jason Albert, will receive the award for his dissertation paper titled "Strategic Dynamics of Antibiotic Use and the Evolution of Antibiotic-Resistant Infections". </a>  The event was established by the Razin family in 1997 to honor the memory of Ofair Razin (1966 - 1996; PhD, Georgetown University, 1996). <a href= "http://econ.georgetown.edu/phd/razin-price"> More on the background and history of the Razin Prize and Policy Lecture can be found here  </a> </p>
