GCER Fellow <a href="http://faculty.georgetown.edu/mh5/">Mark Huggett</a> and his co-author Alejandro Badal, who is an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, used one of the world's most powerful supercomputers at the Texas Advanced Computing Center@@@ (TACC) to simulate the behavior of millions of model households. "When one builds an economic model, a typical assumption is that agents make best choices to maximize their welfare", says Huggett. "Solving a maximization problem by computer can take a particularly long time if the number of possible states of individuals are very large".

</p>To address this computational challenge, Badel and Huggett turned to Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) at the TACC to run simulations of their model economy. </p>
