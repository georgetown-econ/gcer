New research by GCER Fellow <a href="http://faculty.georgetown.edu/mh5/">Mark Huggett</a> and St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank economist (and former GU PhD student)  Alejandro Badel is featured in a recent publication of the  Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) at the University of Texas@@@. Badel and Huggett  develop  a quantitative model to analyze the effects of taxing top earners in the U.S.  They find optimal tax rates that are higher than those that prevail currently  but significantly lower than those  proposed  by a number of prominent economists. Badel and Huggett show that these proposals over-penalize top earners and generate lower tax revenue overall.</p>

<p>The TACC article  emphasizes  the role played by the  Stampede supercomputer at the University of Texas.  Badel and Huggett turned to Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) at the TACC to calibrate their model.</p>
