<p>  New research by two recent GU Economics Phd students <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/boutonllj/"> Jake Mortenson and Andrew Whitten  </a>  is  featured in the Wall Street Journal's on-line edition. The article, entitled  <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2016/02/11/how-some-americans-hit-the-maximum-tax-refund-sweet-spot/">  "How Some Americans Hit the Maximum Tax-Refund Sweet Spot" </a> discusses research by Mortenson and Whitten on   <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2719859"> "Tax Bunching"  </a>  that uses @@@ tax return data to  document how reported incomes on tax returns  tend to be bunched at the break points in the federal   code.    Their results quantify the effects of discrete changes in marginal tax rates  on the reporting and work incentives of households.   </p>
