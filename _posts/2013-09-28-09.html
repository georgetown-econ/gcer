            <p>  IZA and the Georgetown Center of Economic Research (GCER) of Georgetown University's Economics Department are very pleased to announce the third IZA@DC Young Scholar Program which will take place from September 21 -- 26, 2014 at Georgetown University in Washington DC. The program is a joint effort by GCER and the IZA to bring outstanding PhD students to Washington, DC.  </p>
            <p>The program encourages interaction between talented PhD students and labor economists located in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. On each of the five days of the program a leading labor economist will present his/her frontier research. Students will be given the opportunity to collectively meet with each of the speakers and to discuss their own research. In addition the students will formally present their own research. They will also visit IZA Research Fellows located in Washington, DC at their home institutions. The program is designed for advanced PhD students from outside the US working in the field of labor economics with an interest in joint research projects with local universities or public institutions in the DC area. The number of participants is limited to a maximum of 10 students.
            </p><p> IZA Research Fellows located outside the US can nominate their PhD students by submitting a nomination statement, the studentâ€™s CV and research paper by April 20, 2014 using the <a href="http://www.iza.org/conference_files/DC_2014/call_for_papers" target="_blank">online nomination form</a>.
