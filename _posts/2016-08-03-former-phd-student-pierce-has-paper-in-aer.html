<p> A recent GU graduate of the Department of Economics, <a  href="http://www.justinrpierce.com/"> Justin Pierce</a>, publishes paper in the most recent American Economic Review. The paper   <a href="http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.20131578"> "The Surprisingly Swift Decline of
US Manufacturing Employment" </a> links a  `sharp drop in US manufacturing employment
after 2000 to a change in US trade policy that eliminated potential
tariff increases on Chinese imports.'  The paper was jointly authored with Peter K. Schott of the Yale School of Management.
