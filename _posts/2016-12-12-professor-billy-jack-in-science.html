<a  href="https://blogs.commons.georgetown.edu/billyjack/">Professor Billy Jack</a> recently published article in <a  href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/354/6317/1288">Science</a>, shares the analysis of data collected over a six year period in Kenya that has revealed that the country's mobile money platform, M-PESA, has lifted nearly 200,000 households out of poverty. The effects of this form of digital financial inclusion are particularly strong for female headed households, with an estimated 185,000 women moving from agriculture to business as their primary occupation as a result of the expansion of mobile money. The study, conducted by Tavneet Suri at MIT Sloan with Billy Jack from Georgetown's Department of Economics, appears in the current issue of Science Magazine.
