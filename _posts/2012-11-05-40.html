            The Georgetown Department of Economics and the Georgetown Center for Economic Research are very pleased to announce that  <a href="http://econ.worldbank.org/staff/mravallion" target="_blank">  Martin Ravallion </a>   will be joining the Department and GCER  in January 2013  as the inaugural Edmond D. Villani Chaired Professor in Economics.      Professor Ravallion  will be moving  to Georgetown from the World Bank where he currently holds the position of Director of the Development Research Group.<p></p>
            <p>With nearly 300 publications, Professor  Ravallion is one of the most prominent development economists in the world. His work has led to new ways of thinking about economic decisions and empirical regularities in development. </p>
            <p>Professor  Ravallion's research is wide-ranging.  His early work on the 1974 famine in Bangladesh explained and documented the  various economic and political forces that  led to sharply increasing rice prices and later  to  widespread famine. His work would eventually become  a companion to the theory of famines developed around the same time by future Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen.   Ravallion  would  later  develop usable indicators of poverty, including the now famous "dollar-a-day" poverty line,  and explore the role of limited commitment  in the ability of informally organized groups to provide their members with insurance.  More recently, Ravallion has written extensively on China and India, assessing the links between growth and poverty reduction in the  two countries. </p>
            <p>Much of Professor Ravallion's work is now standard reading for students in   development economics.  Both the empirical measures and the theories  he developed  form the basis of countless studies over the past two  decades. </p>
            <p>Martin Ravallion received his PhD from the London School of Economics and Political Science in 1981.  He  went on to hold positions at Oxford University and the Australian National University, before joining the World Bank in 1988.  As current  Director of the Development Research Group,  he manages and supervises a  staff that  shapes  and executes  the Bank's research agenda  and provides expertise to policy makers at the highest levels.  Professor Ravallion has  held visiting positions at numerous institutions  including Princeton, Toulouse, Warwick, the Australian National University, the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies, and Gadja Mada University in Indonesia.</p>
