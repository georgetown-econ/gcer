            <h2>  <a name="laurent-guns" id="laurent-guns"></a>  *July, 2014. GCER Fellow Bouton's work featured in The Economist. </h2>
            <p> GCER Fellow <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/boutonllj/">Laurent Bouton's</a> paper <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0Bz2volNj-oH7dDVGNWdJNkxOekU/edit"> guns and votes</a> has been featured in <a href="http://wunc.org/post/republican-us-senatorial-primary-candidates-face-tough-race">The Economist</a> and <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/in-the-papers-gun-control-gender-equality-and-taxes/">FiveThirtyEight</a>. In his paper, Bouton argues that re-election motives can lead politicians to take a pro-gun stance against the interests of an apathetic majority of the electorate, but in line with the interests of an intense minority.</p>
