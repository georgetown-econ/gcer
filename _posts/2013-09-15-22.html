            <h3> Second Lecture to be delivered in October by Google's     <a href="http://www.mcafee.cc/" target="_new">Preston McAfee </a> </h3>
            <p align="left"> The 2013-2014 GCER Distinguished Lecture series resumes in September with Professor <a href="http://www.econ.northwestern.edu/people/faculty/charles-manski.html" target="_new">Charles Manski</a>  as its first speaker. Professor Manski  
              will deliver series of lectures  at GU on September 9-10 on his new book, <b>Public Policy in an Uncertain World: Analysis and Decisions</b> (Harvard University Press, 2013) and on some technical articles that form the foundation for the book. In the book, Manski describes the practice of policy analysis and the inferential problems that researchers confront. He argues that credible analysis typically yields interval rather than point predictions of policy outcomes. He examines how governments might reasonably make policy decisions when they only have partial knowledge of policy outcomes.
