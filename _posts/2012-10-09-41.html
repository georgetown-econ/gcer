<p>A recent issue of Georgetown College News reports that Associate Professor and GCER Fellow <a href="http://explore.georgetown.edu/people/wgj/">Billy Jack</a>, sent Yun Ling, Lucie Parker, Alec Villec and Cindy Yang(F'12) to Nairobi to work with him on his current field projects. Professor Jack has conducted extensive research in eastern Africa. Over the summer, he showed the students how their economics knowledge could be applied to a range of topics from <a href="http://www.georgetown.edu/story/kenya-road-safety-study.html">road safety</a> and maternal health saving to financial literacy for Kenyan teens. They also learned how their economics skills can effect change from this trip.</p>
