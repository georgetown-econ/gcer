<p>  New research by GCER economist <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/boutonllj/"> Laurent Bouton </a>  is  featured in the June 2015 on-line edition of the Atlantic. The article, entitled  <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/06/reviews-economics-resturants-customers-yelp/395225/">   "Consumers love rankings, but they may end up doing more harm than good" </a> discusses Bouton's <a> href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz2volNj-oH7VHFqbldlX3pnajQ/view/" paper  </a>  with co-author  Georg Kirchsteiger  on the paradox of ranking and rating systems of consumer products... @@@ Focussing on the proliferation of rating systems of restaurants,  Bouton and Kirchsteiger argue that in markets with consumption spillovers, rankings may be detrimental to consumers. In the case of restaurants, rankings may induce "too much" pooling of different types of consumers into a given, capacity-limited, restaurant.  In the absence of rankings, consumers would be more dispersed across a variety of restaurants  and thus better off <em> ex ante. </em> </p>
