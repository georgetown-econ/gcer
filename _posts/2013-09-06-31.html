            </p><p> The talk is entitled: <b>Female Labour Supply, Human Capital and Tax Reform</b></p>
            <p> The UK together with many other countries have put in place a system of tax credits to subsidize work for low paid individuals. We consider the impact of such tax policies on women over the lifecycle. We focus on the effects of tax credits on education choice, employment, hours and human capital accumulation. By modeling education choices and introducing a channel of impacts through on- the-job human capital accumulation we are able to better understand both the short run incentive effects and the longer run implications for poverty and inequality for tax credits and other aspects of tax and welfare benefits. Moreover, individuals in the model are risk averse and can accumulate financial assets which serve for short run smoothing, retirement and precautionary savings. Within this context we can also assess the insurance value of these major welfare programs and the welfare effects of risk in the presence of public insurance. We find substantial labor supply elasticities. We also find that for lower education individuals the welfare programs have substantial insurance value. </p>
