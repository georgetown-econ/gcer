<p> It is with great pride that the Economics Department announces that Martin Ravallion, the Edmond D.Villani Professor of Economics, has been awarded a <a href=" http://www.fbbva.es/TLFU/tlfu/ing/microsites/premios/fronteras/galardonados/2015/desarrollo.jsp">  BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award for his research on global poverty.</a> 
Department Chair Frank Vella said "Martin is a remarkable scholar and his dedication to scholarship and research is an inspiration for all those who encounter him or his work. @@@ While his work reflects the academic goals of measuring the extent and understanding the causes of poverty, it is motivated by his greater personal commitment to help those who suffer the consequences of such living conditions. This award is further recognition of the importance and impact of Martin's work." </p>
